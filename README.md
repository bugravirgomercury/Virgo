# :virgo: Virgo
Virgo is a C++ library wrapping the Win32 C APIs into reasonable set of classes.

## How To Modify
Download the repository and edit in Visual Studio. (I'll add support for other choices in the future)
I'll also add CMake support for completeness.

## Example
As Virgo is in INCUBATION state, there is no example (not even a solid API). Wait and it will be here.

## Contributing
Pull requests are welcome. For major changes, please open an issue first to discuss what you would like to change.

Please make sure to update tests as appropriate.
